# GestYourLife---hand-gesture-recognition-for-people-with-disabilities

System framework for people with disabilities. 
Based on Myo-ArmBand and another software components such :
    1. Node.Js - connected to Myo and extract gesture performed
    2. Django-Rest-API - define routes for specifically purposes like : login, insert/get to firebase
    3. Android application - connected to firebase and extract data using listeners and snapshots, push notifications to the end-user

We have build a system framework which is incoming between a patient( a person with disabilities ) and the caregiver destinated. Using this system, the patient perform a gesture and the caregiver are immediatly informed about the latest needs.
